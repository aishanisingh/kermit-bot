# KermitBot

## About
Hey! Thank you for looking at my project. This is KermitBot, a bot I made for fun which can do lots of fun commands! 

## Usage 
Once you invite KermitBot into your server, you can type in `-help` to see all of his commands. Some of his commands are:
* `-meme`
* `-news`
* `-inspire`

To see some examples of how KermitBot works, go to https://github.com/aishanisingh/kermit-bot/tree/main/Examples

## Notes
Right now, KermitBot is not fully functional and only works when my laptop is online. That will be fixed soon :') To add KermitBot to your server, simply press this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=841107411690586153&permissions=2617764951&scope=bot (Please remember that Kermit needs to be able to manage webhooks in order to send messages!)

Have fun!
